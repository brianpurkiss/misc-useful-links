This is a list of plugins that I use on various projects for various reasons. The only rhyme or reason to this list is plugins that I regularly use so I don't forget them. Why Github? Because it's easy to keep this stuff in an accessible place and keep track of what I start and stop using. It's also pretty easy to send this list to coworkers and other people interested in this info. Just think of this as a personal list that I keep public for anyone to look at. Why anyone would want to look at it... who knows...
